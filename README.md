# Assignment8ConcurrencyVersion5
Concurrency project with test driven development. 
By: Ethan Nephew

This project is designed to demonstrate the power of concurrency. 

I developed the project utilicizing an iterative test-driven methodology. I'd estimate that it took 20+ hours to reach the completiton state. 
I casually experimented with various other concepts that I had. 
The base of the project was in the decision that I wanted a base class definition that would house all of the values needed for a thread to use.
